Sample code for interfacing with I2C devices at Nao Hackathon London April 2015.

For information on devices, see www.robot-electronics.co.uk.
This repository is in no way affiliated with or representing robot-electronics, but they do have rather helpful documentation for the products they provide.

There are probably better libraries for doing this out there, but we've not found many good and easy to read examples of this code for python, so... here it is.

Heavily influenced by the work of cclement (and with thanks to him for his assistance).
